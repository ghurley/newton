# Newton's Method Fractal Generation

Code to draw the Newton's method fractal for the solutions to zÂ³ - 1 = 0. I've
written solutions several times in different languages/environments. It's meaty
enough to require some actual work but still tractable, particularly if you
don't need to roll your own complex point structs/arithmetic.

Here, it offered a chance to learn go, its tools, and how golang packages are
typically structured.

It runs surprisingly slowly and I think it got a lot slower with a recent golang
update. About 1300ms on my MacBookAir. The most recent of my prior
implementations of this code was in JavaScript and it computed the same size
image in under 200ms on the same hardware.

The slowness on the older golang version
seemed to be memory allocation related. The new slowness seems more related
to FP math.

```

I'm surprised to see all the trig functions (and satan!) which I don't invoke
directly so they may all come from the `cmplx.Abs()`. Even if I managed to get
rid of all of that slowness, the runtime.(\*mcentral).grow would still make
this implementation slower than the JS version. According to my "research" (a
10 second perusal of Google search results) grow is memory/heap allocation.
The fact that there is no listing for `sweep` at least means that I don't need
to fight the GC. Still, 270ms for memory allocation is insane. Maybe I should
preallocate a fixed size array of `color.RGBA`s instead of creating
and returning them one at a time.
